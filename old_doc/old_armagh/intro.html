			<h3>Armagh ETL</h3>	
			<p>The Irish saved civilization.  Literally.</p>
			<p>In the Middle Ages, the job of preserving and disseminating the written word fell to many talented
				monks.  The process they employed was a model of efficiency and a good example for those wishing
				to follow in their footsteps.</p>
			<p>The center of activity was the <i>scriptorium</i>.
				In each monastic scriptorium across Europe, the armarius ("provisioner") collected 
				piles of documents from various sources
				and made them available to scribes to copy and illuminate.  
				Scribes painstakingly took to their tasks, transcribing the original works.  As collections
				of works were completed, other religious and secular customers sent their librarians to the 
				scriptorium to collect them.</p>
				<p>Some documents were in bad condition and what the provisioner recovered were just
					scraps of documents.  These scraps were passed to archivists who would organize them, patch
					them together, and pass the patchworks to the scribes, who would in turn transcribe as always.
				</p>
				<p>Each scriptorium was run under the watchful eyes of the Abbot and his assistant, the Prior. 
					They made sure that the scriptorium was
					adequately staffed for its current workload, and that work was flowing as it should.  Above them - and
					outside the scriptorium proper - was the Bishop, who established and maintained agreements with
					sources and customers and provided the scriptorium's basic resources.</p>
			<p>The most renowned scriptorium in Ireland was at Armagh.</p>
